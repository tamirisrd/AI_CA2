    "\n",
    "Three and Graph are both non-linear structures, which means both are data structures where data are not arranged in a sequential order. However, they are pretty different from each other in structure and properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Graph is an arrangement of nodes or vertices (V) connected by edges (E), illustrating these nodes' relationships. The vertices are represented by circles, and the edges are line segments connecting the circles (V). In a graph, there are different ways of structuring. More than one path is allowed, which means the V can be connected to any number of V through E; E can contain weight; it can have loops, dismissing the need for a root node. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While Graphs represent a network, a Tree is used to illustrate a hierarchy. In a Tree graph model, the data is organized in sorted order and has n-1 edges. Only one path is allowed between the nodes, which means every node is connected to every other node by exactly one path. Also, the connection in this model is acyclic thus, it does not contain any. Nonetheless, it contains a root node as a starting point. Trees can be binary or non-binary; in the latter, there can be any number of children in each node, but the former cannot have more than two children.\n",

    "#### Explain in detail how the graph is an abstraction of the problem [0-5]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is fundamentally how we approach problems in computer science. As a problem-solving tool, the purpose is to simplify complex systems by highlighting only the essential information, eliminating unnecessary details and focusing only on what is key to reaching the objective. To do so, the problem is broken down into smaller and more manageable components until it comes to a point where a known solution exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, it might be relatively easy to look at a map, for example, and extract the information necessary, but for a computer, it is not as easy. Graph facilitates standard analysis techniques and the development of efficient algorithms for abstracted problem descriptions, it serve as a powerful abstraction tool for problem-solving, specially in domains with underlying strucutres that can be represented by vertices and edges. By using graph algorithms, there are more chances of the problem being solved with correctness and running time guarantees, improving the problem-solving capacities within reasonable time and resource constraints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, graphs can be applied to airline flight service maps where the V and E correspond to cities and flights. By using the max flow algorithm, the airline can define the crew and equipment necessary to execute the flight schedules efficiently."

    "#### Identify the advantages of using a visualisation such as the one showing in Fig. 1 [0-5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualisation in Fig 1 is a graph. Using those models when analysing data is beneficial as they are easier to understand. The human brain processes visual information quicker than written data, and the innate ability of the human eye to detect patterns within the graphs makes complex networks more uncomplicated. Consequently, with data being absorbed faster, a faster action response will generate more efficient data processing and interpretation. Also, Graphs make it easier to depict various data structures and simulate real-world circumstances that can affect them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that Graphs can be more interactive, allowing people to explore data by searching and facilitating the discovery of patterns. That may culminate in a more creative approach with new insights.  "
