    "The creator of the puzzle has been told that the A* algorithm is more efficient at finding the shortest path because it uses heuristics. Compare the performance of Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A* search algorithm, referring to heuristics, to find the shortest path to the problem by implementing both algorithms programmatically and comparing the solutions generated in Mark-down. Refer to the complexity of the algorithms and compare the actual time it takes for the solutions to be processed. [0-60]"
